What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a new reporitory git creates a new folder in which it saves all the changes of the files.
So you need to do this because git won't work without this.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area has a few differences with the repository. 
You can decide which files you want to have in it. You don't have to do all files into it. So it belongs just to yourself.
And every file you take in it gets bundled for the commits you make so it is pretty clever. 
The repository on the other hand as all files of your project in it. It is more or less not your decision which files you want to have in it. 
I think the big value it offers comes because you can decide which files belong to it and so on which files are bundled in your commit.
