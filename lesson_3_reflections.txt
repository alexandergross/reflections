When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want that when i work with others on one project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because not every commit should be in the remote automatically. Some changes or new features need mor than one commit. So it would make no sense when the ramote has changes that are not finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are only on git. They are clones but just for git. You can also see how many forks someone has. And you can see who has set a fork on your repository.
Clones are just copies of a repository which are mady local from one computer to an other. So there is nothing in the cloud like on git. 
Branches are only in the repository. You can have different branches in it with different versions of the code.
